# radius-report
This file is a Microsoft SQL Server query that has two parameters, GivenMileRadius and Zipcode. It calculates the distance of each zipcode using the latitude and longitude to find records that are within your given radius. This has been used for MS CRM but can be ported to other services. For this version, it assumes you have an entity for the latitude and longtitude of zipcodes.
